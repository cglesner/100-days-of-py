# 100-days-of-py
Write a simple, complete program every day for 100 days.

Day 1:
* Wrote `dotproduct.calculate` to calculate a dot product 
of two n-dimentional vectors.

Day 2:
* Wrote `crossproduct.calcuate` to calculate a cross product
of two 3-dimentional vectors (cross product only defined
for 3-D vectors).

Day 3:
* Wrote `sequences.fibonacci` to calculate the n-th term in
the fibonacci sequence.

* Wrote `dotproduct.orthogonal` to calculate a vector
orthogonal to an n-dimensional input vector.

Day 4:
* Refactored `sequence.fibonacci` and `dotproduct.orthogonal`.
